          <div class="body-text">California’s climate has been historically subject to both prolonged droughts and extreme rainfall during the winter months. Additonally, the well-being of the state and its inhabitants is significantly impacted by the weather. There is empirical evidence that the global climate state during the late summer months (July through October) is a potential predictor for the winter California climate (November through March), which is traditionally difficult to predict and exhibits high variability. This research leverages deep learning methods to predict the climate for winter months for three different California regions (North, Central, and South), based on the summer climate state.
          </div>
          <div class="body-text">Our research uses Convolutional Neural Network to create predictions on simulated climate data from the Community Earth System Model 2 (CESM2). This model is regarded as one of the best open source climate models available and offers 100 simulations over the years 1940-2014. While we are still working to fine tune the model to obtain improved results, we have already improved on the predictive performance of sophisticated linear regression models based on the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO).
